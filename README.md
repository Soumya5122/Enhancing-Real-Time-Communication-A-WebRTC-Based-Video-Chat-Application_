# Video Chat Application 
Video chat applications are widely used for various purposes, such as social,
educational, and professional communication. However, developing a video chat
application can be challenging, as it requires handling complex issues such as network
latency, bandwidth, security, and compatibility. Web Real-Time Communication
(WebRTC) is a cutting-edge technology that enables peer-to-peer real-time
communication without the need for additional software or plugins. WebRTC is a set of
APIs and protocols that allow browsers and mobile applications to exchange audio, video,
and data streams directly, without relying on intermediate servers or platforms. In this
paper, we propose a video chat application that uses WebRTC and Node.js, a JavaScript
runtime environment that allows for fast and scalable network applications.
